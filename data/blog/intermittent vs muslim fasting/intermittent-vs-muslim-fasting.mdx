# What is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It primarily focuses on when you eat rather than what you eat, with common methods including the 16/8 method (16 hours fasting, 8 hours eating) and the 5:2 method (normal eating for five days, restricted calories for two days). IF aims to improve metabolic health and promote weight loss.

## How its different from Islamic Fasts?

Fasting in Islam, known as Sawm, is the practice of abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs from dawn until sunset during the holy month of Ramadan. Muslims fast as an act of worship and obedience to Allah, aiming to develop self-discipline, spiritual growth, and empathy for the less fortunate.

Fasting during Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, making it a fundamental aspect of Muslim faith and practice.

## Why am I comparing bothü§î?

On Paper, both are almost same things, like you abstaining from food. You observe intermittent fast solely for your health & weight-loss. The time most people choose for it is: eating 4 hours before sleeping and addding 8 hours of sleep in it and then adding 4 hours of fasting time after waking up.

First few days go kind of easy due to initial motivation but it wears extremely soon, and you are back onto your old habbit.

While Islamic Fast is: You wake up 1:30 hour(about 3:30AM - time varries accross the planet) before sun rise and you eat good meal not to heavy like 3 Slices of bread with 1-2 eggs & a cup of coffee. and don't forget to drink lots of water because you are not allowed to drink water unlike intermittent fasting.

After that you wait for the Adhan and then you pray Fajr prayer(at about 4AM - time varries accross the planet). Then you can sleep and wake up when ever you like.

Now, this is the hard part of the fasting, spending your day without eating and drinking. Doing your work/jobüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª. After üïõ12PM you may start feeling dizzy(specially if you are doing it for the first time), but the reward from the God Almighty is driver of your body and helps you go through fast.
It is also a form of Jihad. Did I just hear Jihad? AllahuAkbar BOOMüí•, its not that LOLüòπ.

Jihad is a struggle, a struggle to be a better person, a better Muslim, a better human being.

Well! Anyways, you break your fast at the time of sunset which happens to be maghrib prayer time.

## Reasons to Fast

- **Spiritual Growth:** Fasting fosters a deeper connection with your faith and spirituality.
- **Self-Discipline:** It helps develop self-control and discipline.
- **Empathy:** Fasting increases empathy for the less fortunate by experiencing hunger and thirst.
- **Detoxification:** It gives your body a break, aiding in the detoxification process.
- **Improved Metabolism:** Fasting can improve metabolic health and support weight management.
- **Mental Clarity:** Many people experience enhanced focus and mental clarity while fasting.
- **Enhanced Immune Function:** Fasting can boost your immune system by promoting cellular repair and regeneration.
- **Mindful Eating:** It encourages more mindful eating habits and awareness of food choices.

## How much days should you fast? Realistic approach

At start I would say that 2 days a week will be best to get you started on fasting, I would recommend Mondays and Thursdays.

Remember, consistency is key when it comes to fasting. Starting with just two days a week allows you to ease into the practice and gradually build up your fasting duration if desired. Listen to your body, stay hydrated, and focus on nourishing foods during your eating windows to maximize the benefits of fasting.

## Conclusion

My fasting journey has definitely helped me a lot, in starting its tough for sure but after some days of fasting your body will adapt and start using internal fat as fuel to run your body.

Overtime your body will adjust to work on even less food, don't cut your food intake by extreme measure but be mindful of what you are eating and drinking.

## One last thing

Avoid sugar totally, I'm talking about added sugar like one that you add in your Milk, Tea, Coffee, etc. Because you are already consuming sugar automatically through natural diet.

I will write a blog on the Sugar Poison soon.

## Fasting is one part of the journey and combine with the second part which is cutting added sugar completely.

See you soon!
