## Introduction

I sat down asked myself of creating a small exciting project using WebGL powered technologies.
I decided to create a 3D customizable shirt using ThreeJS and ReactJS.
Created a 3D model of a shirt using Blender and imported it into ThreeJS.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS using Vite**
- **@react-three/drei** - Fully functional, ready-made abstractions for `@react-three/fiber`.
- **@react-three/fiber** - It is a React renderer for three.js.
- **framer-motion** - An open source motion library for React, made by Framer.
- **maath** - This is a collection of useful math helpers, random generators, bits and bobs. The library is mostly meant to be used with three.js.
- **react-color** - for color wheel picker.
- **three** - three for, you guessed it ThreeJS.
- **valtio** - for state management.

## Color Wheel

**Color Wheel** - Allows users to change color of the shirt by a color wheel.

## Logo / Texture

**File Upload** - User can upload `image` file and then can set the image as a Logo on shirt or Full Texture.

## Logo / Texture Toggle

Simple toggle buttons for user to toggle on/off between logo and texture.

## Download .png Shirt

After customizing shirt according to your liking, you can hit download button to save png file of shirt.

## Future Updates

I will be adding saving shirt design by storing them in localstorage.
Also adding AI chat prompt for generating designs for shirt.

Thank you so much for reading {'<3'} and Enjoy playing with it.
